<p>This summary provides key statistical measures for all numeric variables, including measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, interquartile range), as well as skewness and kurtosis to understand the distribution shape.</p>
<p>The summary statistics highlight the central tendencies and dispersion of the numeric variables. For instance, variables with high skewness and kurtosis values might indicate outliers or non-normal distributions, which may require transformation or special handling in modeling.</p>

<p>The quantile-quantile plot helps in assessing whether the numeric variables follow a particular distribution, such as the normal distribution. The Q-Q plots allow us to visually assess the normality of the numeric variables. Deviations from the diagonal line suggest that the data may not be normally distributed, which could impact parametric statistical analyses.</p>

<p>Density plots provide a smoothed estimate of the data distribution, allowing for easy visualization of the distribution shape and comparison between different variables.</p>
<p>Density plots show the distribution of each numeric variable. Peaks in the density plots indicate modes, and the spread indicates variability. These plots help in understanding the distribution and identifying any potential skewness or multimodality.</p>

<p>This section provides a frequency table for all categorical variables, showing the count and percentage of each category within the variable. The frequency tables indicate how often each category occurs in the dataset. This is crucial for understanding the distribution of categorical variables and identifying any categories that might dominate or be underrepresented.</p>

<p>Bar plots for all categorical variables visualize the distribution of categories within each variable, making it easy to see which categories are most or least common.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bar-plots-with-vertical-or-horizontal-bars-for-all-categorical-variables">Bar plots with vertical or horizontal bars for all categorical variables</h3>
<p>The following section identifies and visualizes categorical variables with fewer than 11 unique values using bar plots. This is particularly useful for variables with a manageable number of categories.</p>
<p>Bar plots provide a visual representation of the categorical variablesâ€™ distributions. This helps in quickly identifying the most and least common categories. Such visualizations are useful for understanding the dataâ€™s structure and for subsequent analyses like feature selection.</p>
